### Usege:
Our model consists of 2 parts.
The first part is about 3DV point data generation and apprearance point data preparation.
For example, "3DV_construction\python\ntu120_3dv_pre.py" is used to generate the 3DV point data with multiple motion features. The output 3DV points data form is N*(x,y,z,m_g,m_1,...,m_T)
"3DV_construction\python\RawDepthPoints_appearance_pre.py" is used to sample multi-segment temporal frames with its raw points into the form of  N*(x,y,z).

The second part is about multi-stream PointNet++. The generated point data in part 1 can be fed to Network.
